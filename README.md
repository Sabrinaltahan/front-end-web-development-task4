In this task, you must further develop your website from the previous laboratory in Moment 3.

Create another HTML page that you name "Animation", make sure it is linked in the main menu. In this subsection you will work with this laboratory.

Code for animations and designs should be written in SASS files. Develop your existing SASS files, usefully create a partial for your animations.

The solution must at least consist of the following:

Text or image animation - Use CSS to create animations. These can be effects such as shadows, color changes, size changes or movements.
Moving Objects - Use CSS to create an animation where an object moves across the page. You can use @keyframes to define different positions during the animation.
User Interaction - Some type of animation should be triggered when a user integrates with an element on the page. For example, pressing a button, filling in a form, scrolling down the page, etc
You must create at least 3 different types of animations using @keyframes, transition and transform in CSS. This is optional as long as it meets the requirements above.

ATTENTION! This is a task where you can be very creative. It is not approved to copy code from theory material without further development of the code.

You choose which types of animations you want to include in your website.

Suggestions for different animations:

Shadow and light effects - Use "box-shadow" or "text-shadow" to create shadow or light effects that change over time.
Backgrounds with color transitions - It is possible to make a lot of effects with different color transitions (gradient) that, for example, change over time, when hovering, follows the user's mouse pointer, for example.
Backgrounds and parallax effects - Use "transform" to create parallax effects with background images.
Button Animations - Add hover effects or transitions to buttons to make them more interactive.
Loading Animations - Use animations to create loading effects when the page loads. Can be useful for the user to see something happen on the page, when a button is pressed, a form is uploaded, etc.
Animated Navigation Menu - Make the navigation menu bigger or smaller depending on whether the user has scrolled or not.
Text effects - Use effects such as text shadow, text rotation or changes in font size.
Image rotation and zoom - Use "transform" to create rotating and zooming effects for images.
